*Purpose*: Confidence and prediction intervals are useful for studying "pure sampling" of some distribution. However, we can combine CI and PI with regression analysis to equip our modeling efforts with powerful notions of uncertainty. In this challenge, you will use fluid simulation data in a regression analysis with uncertainty quantification (CI and PI) to support engineering design.

# Orientation: Exploring Simulation Results

*Background*: The data you will study in this exercise come from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [simulation campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932219308651?via%3Dihub) that studied the interaction of turbulent flow and radiative heat transfer to fluid-suspended particles[1]. These simulations were carried out to help study a novel design of [solar receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power), though they are more aimed at fundamental physics than detailed device design. The following code chunk downloads and unpacks the data to your local `./data/` folder.

```{r data-download-unzip}

![PSAAP II irradiated core flow](./images/psaap-setup.png)Figure 1. An example simulation, frozen at a specific point in time. An initial simulation is run (HIT SECTION) to generate a turbulent flow with particles, and that swirling flow is released into a rectangular domain (RADIATED SECTION) with bulk downstream flow (left to right). Concentrated solar radiation transmits through the optically transparent fluid, but deposits heat into the particles. The particles then convect heat into the fluid, which heats up the flow. The false-color image shows the fluid temperature: Notice that there are "hot spots" where hot particles have deposited heat into the fluid. The dataset `df_psaap` gives measurements of `T_norm = (T - T0) / T0` averaged across planes at various locations along the RADIATED SECTION.

### **q1** Perform your "initial checks" to get a sense of the data.

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Perform your initial checks

df_psaap %>%  
  glimpse()  

df_psaap %>%  
  summary()  
```

**Observations**:

-   It has 140 rows (which I think means 140 different simulation runs) and 22 columns showing different measurements. I can see there are input settings like channel size and flow speed, and output measurements like temperature changes. The measurements were taken at specific spots along the channel (x values like 0.25, 0.5, etc.). Most temperature changes are in the middle range (median around 63%), but there are some really high ones that pull the average up to 74%. I think this means most cases behave normally but some get unusually hot.

The important variables in this dataset are:

| Variable | Category | Meaning                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x`      | Spatial  | Channel location                  |
| `idx`    | Metadata | Simulation run                    |
| `L`      | Input    | Channel length                    |
| `W`      | Input    | Channel width                     |
| `U_0`    | Input    | Bulk velocity                     |
| `N_p`    | Input    | Number of particles               |
| `k_f`    | Input    | Turbulence level                  |
| `T_f`    | Input    | Fluid inlet temp                  |
| `rho_f`  | Input    | Fluid density                     |
| `mu_f`   | Input    | Fluid viscosity                   |
| `lam_f`  | Input    | Fluid conductivity                |
| `C_fp`   | Input    | Fluid isobaric heat capacity      |
| `rho_p`  | Input    | Particle density                  |
| `d_p`    | Input    | Particle diameter                 |
| `C_pv`   | Input    | Particle isochoric heat capacity  |
| `h`      | Input    | Convection coefficient            |
| `I_0`    | Input    | Radiation intensity               |
| `eps_p`  | Input    | Radiation absorption coefficient  |
| `avg_q`  | Output   | Plane-averaged heat flux          |
| `avg_T`  | Output   | Plane-averaged fluid temperature  |
| `rms_T`  | Output   | Plane-rms fluid temperature       |
| `T_norm` | Output   | Normalized fluid temperature rise |

The primary output of interest is `T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f`, the normalized (dimensionless) temperature rise of the fluid, due to heat transfer. These measurements are taken at locations `x` along a column of fluid, for different experimental settings (e.g. different dimensions `W, L`, different flow speeds `U_0`, etc.).

### **q2** Visualize `T_norm` against `x`. Note that there are multiple simulations at different values of the Input variables: Each simulation result is identified by a different value of `idx`.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Visualize the data in df_psaap with T_norm against x;
##       design your visual to handle the multiple simulations,
##       each identified by different values of idx

df_psaap %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = T_norm, group = idx)) +  
  geom_line(alpha = 0.3) +  
  labs(  
    title = "Normalized Temperature Rise Along Channel",  
    x = "Channel Location (x)",  
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (T_norm)"  
  ) +  
  theme_minimal()  
```

## Modeling

The following chunk will split the data into training and validation sets.

```{r data-split}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
# Addl' Note: These data are already randomized by idx; no need
# to additionally shuffle the data!
df_train <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 1:20)
df_validate <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 21:36)
```

One of the key decisions we must make in modeling is choosing predictors (features) from our observations to include in the model. Ideally we should have some intuition for why these predictors are reasonable to include in the model; for instance, we saw above that location along the flow `x` tends to affect the temperature rise `T_norm`. This is because fluid downstream has been exposed to solar radiation for longer, and thus is likely to be at a higher temperature.

Reasoning about our variables---at least at a *high level*---can help us to avoid including *fallacious* predictors in our models. You'll explore this idea in the next task.

### **q3** The following code chunk fits a few different models. Compute a measure of model accuracy for each model on `df_validate`, and compare their performance.

```{r q3-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit these models
fit_baseline <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_cheat <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ avg_T)

fit_nonphysical <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ idx)

## TODO: Compute a measure of accuracy for each fit above;
##       compare their relative performance

model_comparison <- tibble(
  Model = c("Cheat (avg_T)", "Baseline (x only)", "Nonphysical (idx)"),
  RMSE = c(
    sqrt(mean((predict(fit_cheat, df_validate) - df_validate$T_norm)^2)),
    sqrt(mean((predict(fit_baseline, df_validate) - df_validate$T_norm)^2)),
    sqrt(mean((predict(fit_nonphysical, df_validate) - df_validate$T_norm)^2))
  )
)

model_comparison %>% 
  arrange(RMSE)
```

**Observations**:

-   Which model is *most accurate*? Which is *least accurate*?
    -   The "cheat" model using avg_T is most accurate (RMSE = 0.232), while the model using only idx is least accurate (RMSE = 0.399). The baseline model with just x falls in between (RMSE = 0.284).
-   What *Category* of variable is `avg_T`? Why is it such an effective predictor?
    -   avg_T is an Output variable (the measured average temperature). It's super effective because T_norm is mathematically derived from it (T_norm = (avg_T - T_f)/T_f), creating a perfect circular relationship that wouldn't exist with real-world prediction tasks.
-   Would we have access to `avg_T` if we were trying to predict a *new* value of `T_norm`? Is `avg_T` a valid predictor?
    -   No - we wouldn't have avg_T when trying to predict new T_norm values. While it technically works mathematically, it's not a valid predictor because: it requires knowing the answer to predict the answer, creates data leakage, defeats the purpose of prediction.
-   What *Category* of variable is `idx`? Does it have any physical meaning?
    -   idx is a Metadata variable - just a simulation ID number. It has zero physical meaning regarding the fluid dynamics; it's simply an arbitrary counter tracking which simulation run produced the data. Using it as a predictor is meaningless since simulation #5 isn't inherently different from #4 in terms of the physics.

### **q4** Interpret this model

Interpret the following model by answering the questions below.

*Note*. The `-` syntax in R formulas allows us to exclude columns from fitting. So `T_norm ~ . - x` would fit on all columns *except* `x`.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO: Inspect the regression coefficients for the following model
fit_q4 <- df_train %>%
  lm(T_norm ~ L + W + U_0 + N_p + k_f + T_f, data = .)

# Get coefficients and significance
fit_q4 %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(estimate)))  # Sort by absolute effect size

# For context, calculate SDs of key variables
df_psaap %>%
  summarise(
    sd_x   = sd(x),
    sd_T_f = sd(T_f),
    sd_W   = sd(W)
  )
```

**Observations**:

-   Which columns are excluded in the model formula above? What categories do these belong to? Why are these important quantities to leave out of the model?
    -   The model excludes: Metadata variables (idx) - Just simulation IDs with no physical meaning, output measurements (avg_q, avg_t, rms_T), and many physical inputs.
-   Which inputs are *statistically significant*, according to the model?
    -   At the traditional p \< 0.05 level:
        -   Definitely significant: W (width, p \< 0.0001) and T_f (inlet temp, p \< 0.0001)

        -   Borderline significant: N_p (particle count, p = 0.0515)

        -   Not significant: L, U_0, k_f (all p \> 0.05)
-   What is the regression coefficient for `x`? What about the regression coefficient for `T_f`?
    -   After standardizing width and T_f are the most dominatn predicitors, with N_p marginall significant. The negative sign for T_f indicates higher inlet temperatures reduce relative heating.
-   What is the standard deviation of `x` in `df_psaap`? What about the standard deviation of `T_f`?
    -   x: sd = 0.2805 (relatively small variation)
    -   T_f: sd = 38.94 (much larger variation)
-   How do these standard deviations relate to the regression coefficients for `x` and `T_f`?
    -   The larger standard deviation for T_f helps explain why its coefficient is smaller - a 1-unit change represents a much smaller relative change for T_f than for x. This shows why we can't directly compare raw coefficients to judge importance.
-   Note that literally *all* of the inputs above have *some* effect on the output `T_norm`; so they are all "significant" in that sense. What does this tell us about the limitations of statistical significance for interpreting regression coefficients?
    -   This shows that statistical significance (p-values) depends heavily on:
        1.  Sample size - with enough data, tiny effects become "significant"

        2.  Measurement precision - variables with smaller variation appear more significant

        3.  Model specification - what other variables are included

## Contrasting CI and PI

Let's revisit the ideas of confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals (PI). Let's fit a very simple model to these data, one which only considers the channel location and ignores all other inputs. We'll also use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` (defined in the `setup` chunk above) to add approximate CI and PI to the linear model.

```{r data-simple-model}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
fit_simple <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(data = ., formula = T_norm ~ x)

df_intervals <-
  df_train %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "confidence", prefix = "ci") %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi")
```

The following figure visualizes the regression CI and PI against the objects they are attempting to capture:

```{r data-simple-model-vis}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
df_intervals %>%
  select(T_norm, x, matches("ci|pi")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c("method", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = matches("ci|pi")
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, fit)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, color = method),
    width = 0.05,
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_psaap %>% mutate(method = "ci"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    se = FALSE,
    linetype = 2,
    color = "black"
   ) +
  geom_point(
    data = df_validate %>% mutate(method = "pi"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    size = 0.5
  ) +

  facet_grid(~method) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Channel Location (-)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (-)"
  )
```

Under the `ci` facet we have the regression confidence intervals and the mean trend (computed with all the data `df_psaap`). Under the `pi` facet we have the regression prediction intervals and the `df_validation` observations.

**Punchline**:

-   Confidence intervals are meant to capture the *mean trend*
-   Prediction intervals are meant to capture *new observations*

Both CI and PI are a quantification of the uncertainty in our model, but the two intervals designed to answer different questions.

Since CI and PI are a quantification of uncertainty, they should tend to *narrow* as our model becomes more confident in its predictions. Building a more accurate model will often lead to a reduction in uncertainty. We'll see this phenomenon in action with the following task:

### **q5** The following code will construct a predicted-vs-actual plot with your model from *q4* and add prediction intervals. Study the results and answer the questions below under *observations*.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Run this code and interpret the results
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
## NOTE: This chunk will use your model from q4; it will predict on the
##       validation data, add prediction intervals for every prediction,
##       and visualize the results on a predicted-vs-actual plot. It will
##       also compare against the simple `fit_simple` defined above.
bind_rows(
  df_psaap %>% 
    add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi") %>% 
    select(T_norm, pi_lwr, pi_fit, pi_upr) %>% 
    mutate(model = "x only"),
  df_psaap %>% 
    add_uncertainties(fit_q4, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi") %>% 
    select(T_norm, pi_lwr, pi_fit, pi_upr) %>% 
    mutate(model = "q4"),
) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(T_norm, pi_fit)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "grey80", size = 2) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = pi_lwr, ymax = pi_upr),
    width = 0
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  
  facet_grid(~ model, labeller = label_both) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs Actual",
    x = "Actual T_norm",
    y = "Predicted T_norm"
  )
```

**Observations**:

-   Which model tends to be more accurate? How can you tell from this predicted-vs-actual plot?
    -   The plot compares two models - the simple "x only" model and the more complex "q4" model. The q4 model appears more accurate because of its predicted values are much more clustered tightly around the diagonal reference line.
-   Which model tends to be *more confident* in its predictions? Put differently, which model has *narrower prediction intervals*?
    -   The q4 model shows narrower prediction intervals (tighter error bars) compared to the x-only model. The increased confidence comes from incorporating additional meaningful predictors that reduce uncertainty in the predictions. The simple x-only model has wider intervals because it's working with less information.
-   How many predictors does the `fit_simple` model need in order to make a prediction? What about your model `fit_q4`?
    -   The fit_simple ("x only") model requires just 1 predictor (x) to make predictions. In contrast, the fit_q4 model needs multiple predictors - from the previous question we know it uses L, W, U_0, N_p, k_f, and T_f (6 predictors total). While the more complex model requires more input information, the plot shows this pays off in both better accuracy and greater confidence in predictions.

Based on these results, you might be tempted to always throw every reasonable variable into the model. For some cases, that might be the best choice. However, some variables might be *outside our control*; for example, variables involving human behavior cannot be fully under our control. Other variables may be *too difficult to measure*; for example, it is *in theory* possible to predict the strength of a component by having detailed knowledge of its microstructure. However, it is *patently infeasible* to do a detailed study of *every single component* that gets used in an airplane.

In both cases---human behavior and variable material properties---we would be better off treating those quantities as random variables. There are at least two ways we could treat these factors: 1. Explicitly model some inputs as random variables and construct a model that *propagates* that uncertainty from inputs to outputs, or 2. Implicitly model the uncontrolled the uncontrolled variables by not including them as predictors in the model, and instead relying on the error term $\epsilon$ to represent these unaccounted factors. You will pursue strategy 2. in the following Case Study.

# Case Study: Predicting Performance Ranges

### **q6** You are consulting with a team that is designing a prototype heat transfer device. They are asking you to help determine a *dependable range of values* for `T_norm` they can design around for this *single prototype*. The realized value of `T_norm` must not be too high as it may damage the downstream equipment, but it must also be high enough to extract an acceptable amount of heat.

In order to maximize the conditions under which this device can operate successfully, the design team has chosen to fix the variables listed in the table below, and consider the other variables to fluctuate according to the values observed in `df_psaap`.

| Variable | Value    |
|----------|----------|
| `x`      | 1.0      |
| `L`      | 0.2      |
| `W`      | 0.04     |
| `U_0`    | 1.0      |
| (Other)  | (Varies) |

Your task is to use a regression analysis to deliver to the design team a *dependable range* of values for `T_norm`, given their proposed design, and at a fairly high level `0.8`. Perform your analysis below (use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` with the `level` argument!), and answer the questions below.

*Hint*: This problem will require you to *build a model* by choosing the appropriate variables to include in the analysis. Think about *which variables the design team can control*, and *which variables they have chosen to allow to vary*. You will also need to choose between computing a CI or PI for the design prediction.

```{r q6-task}
# NOTE: No need to change df_design; this is the target the client
#       is considering
df_design <- tibble(x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0)
# NOTE: This is the level the "probability" level customer wants
pr_level <- 0.8

## TODO: Fit a model, assess the uncertainty in your prediction, 
#        use the validation data to check your uncertainty estimates, and 
#        make a recommendation on a *dependable range* of values for T_norm
#        at the point `df_design`
# Fit model with design-relevant variables  

fit_q6_fixed <- df_train %>%
  lm(T_norm ~ x + L + W + U_0, data = .)

df_validate_pred <- df_validate %>%
  add_uncertainties(
    fit_q6_fixed,
    interval = "prediction",
    level    = pr_level,
    prefix   = "pi"
  )

coverage <- mean(
  df_validate_pred$T_norm >= df_validate_pred$pi_lwr &
  df_validate_pred$T_norm <= df_validate_pred$pi_upr
)
print(glue::glue("Validation coverage: {round(coverage, 3)}"))

design_pred <- df_design %>%
  add_uncertainties(
    fit_q6_fixed,
    interval = "prediction",
    level    = pr_level,
    prefix   = "pi"
  )

design_pred
```

**Recommendation**:

-   How much do you trust your model? Why?
    -   I think the mode is okay. I found that 93.3% of actual T_norm values fell inside your 80% Pls, so the model is capturing variability– and even errs on the side of being slightly conservative.
-   What kind of interval---confidence or prediction---would you use for this task, and why?
    -   Prediction intervals; the team wants a range that an individual *future* prototype is likely to exhibit, not an interval for the *mean* T_norm.
-   What fraction of validation cases lie within the intervals you predict? (NB. Make sure to calculate your intervals *based on the validation data*; don't just use one single interval!) How does this compare with `pr_level`?
    -   observed coverage: 0.933; target: 0.8
-   What interval for `T_norm` would you recommend the design team to plan around?
    -   Based on the prediction intervals at 80% confidence level, I recommend the design team plan for T_norm values between 1.45685 and 2.296426 under the specified operating conditions.
    -   Based on the 80% prediction interval from our model, the design team should plan for:\
        T_norm ∈ [0.34, 0.80]
-   Are there any other recommendations you would provide?
    -   Design for extremes (e.g., handle T_norm up to 0.85 for worst-case scenarios)
-   

*Bonus*: One way you could take this analysis further is to recommend which other variables the design team should tightly control. You could do this by fixing values in `df_design` and adding them to the model. An exercise you could carry out would be to systematically test the variables to see which ones the design team should more tightly control.
